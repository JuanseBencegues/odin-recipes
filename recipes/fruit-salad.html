        <h1>Fruit Salad</h1>
        <a href="../index.html">Back to menu</a>
        <p>This fruit salad is <em> perfect </em>for a backyard bbq or any occasion. <strong>There are never leftovers!</strong> This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p>
